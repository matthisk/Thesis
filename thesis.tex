\section{Taxonomy of language features}
Part of my research is the creation of a taxonomy of language features introduced in the ECMAScript 6 specification document. The taxonomy is created in regards to the transformations needed to transform the code to ECMAScript 5 compliant code (with identical semantics).

The taxonomy is created with the help of several dimensions.

\subsection{Transformation level}
At what level is the transformation performed, in other words what information is needed for this transformation.

\subsection{Purely semantic}

\subsection{Introduction of bindings}

\subsection{Depending on bindings (i.e. run-time code)}

\subsection{Compositional}

\subsection{Analysis of sub-terms}

\subsection{Dependency on other transformations}

\subsection{Backwards compatible}

\subsection{Dividable}
