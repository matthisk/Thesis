\lhead{Chapter 7. \emph{Conclusion}}

In this thesis we have made two contributions. First, a taxonomy for language extensions. Second, we have tried to show the \textit{effectiveness} of a language workbench for the task of program transformations. 

The taxonomy can be used to create a categorization of language extensions and estimate the work needed to implement transformation code for a specific extension. The categorization created for the ES6 language extensions proved valuable in estimating difficulty of implementation when reflecting on this categorization subsequently.

The language workbench has been a valuable tool for the implementation of language extensions. However it is inconclusive if it really improves on all aspects as compared to transpilers not using a workbench. The issue of portability does impose a large restriction on our implementation.
